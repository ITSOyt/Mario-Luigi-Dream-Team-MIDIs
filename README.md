# Mario-Luigi-Dream-Team-MIDIs

I created a GitHub account just for this project:
I am attempting to make a music transcription of every song from "Mario & Luigi: Dream Team".
That's great and all, but I don't want to do this for no reason. I want other people to be 
able to use my transcriptions so they don't have to make their own. I use MuseScore for making 
and uploading the sheet music, but they slap anyone who wants to download the project file 
with a "pay us money and we'll think about it", which is why I'm uploading this music to 
Github and including a link to this page on all of my transcriptions.

Because I make these transcriptions with MuseScore, the compressed Musescore 4 format file 
(.mxl) will be the most accurate format in this repository. the MIDI file (.mid, but you 
should know that) will just come from me opening the MuseScore file and clicking the 
"Export MIDI" button. This results in various issues like my bass drum sound transforming into 
a samba whistle. So don't trust the MIDI files. If you want to use my transcriptions but don't 
have MuseScore 4, then just download it already. A small price to pay for accuracy, capiche?

But... about acccuracy. Because I'm not actually very good at making transcriptions - or 
even music in general - this project's transcriptions will probably have a very high 
margin of error (by which I mean there are a lot of mistakes). But be a good musician and 
do something more than complain "sheet music bad". Tell me what is wrong and how to correct 
it. We'll all be better off with your help.

I lied to you [vine boom sound effect]. I will probably not be doing every song in 
the game because some of the songs already have excellent transcriptions for you to 
download (namely "Never Let Up"; there are a total of 2 quintillian transcriptions of 
that song on MuseScore.com and I don't know why). If I'm not going to transcribe a song myself 
then I'll post a link whenever I add the next oringinal transcription.

Becuase I made my Github account the night before typing this, I have no idea how anything 
works here. I'm pretty sure you can do stuff like contribute to this repository and then have 
your own little branch or something, but I'm not sure. The point is, there's no need to do 
that (unless, of course, I lose interest in this project, but I feel like that probably won't 
happen). Just send me the transcription you want me to add, and I'll add it with credit to whoever 
made it.

Finally, all credit for the oringinal music goes to AlphaDream. They inspired me to do this 
project and I never would've been able to without their amazing game. Mario & Luigi: Dream Team 
reamains my favorite game in the series and one of my favorite games of all time. It is and 
always will be a timeless classic, and I think it absoloutely needs more recognition.

And with that, I release you. What are you even doing here, reading a README? You don't read 
liscence agreements, so why would you read this? Go touch some grass.
